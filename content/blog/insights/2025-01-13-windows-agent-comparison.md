Many of you have probably wondered how to best replace NSClient++ with a modern tool. René Gau from ASFINAG has written a [bachelor’s thesis](https://onlinecampus.fernfh.ac.at/pluginfile.php/223278/mod_data/content/298735/Gau_Rene_00230036_SS24_Jungbauer_2024-06-10.pdf) on this very topic, providing a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of the most relevant alternatives. Here’s a little spoiler: if you want to avoid vendor lock-in and exorbitant migration or licensing costs, this [website](https://omd.consol.de/docs/snclient/) has all the information you need!"
