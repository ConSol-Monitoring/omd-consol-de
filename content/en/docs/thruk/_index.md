**[Thruk](https://www.thruk.org)** is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently supports Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken as backend using the Livestatus API.

It is designed to be a 'dropin' replacement and covers almost 100% of the original features plus adds additional enhancements for large installations and increased usability.
