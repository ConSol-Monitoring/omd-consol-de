[Thruk](https://www.thruk.org) is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently supports Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken as backend using the Livestatus API.

It is designed to be a 'dropin' replacement and covers almost 100% of the original features plus adds additional enhancements for large installations and increased usability.

It is included in [OMD](docs/omd/). Sven Nierleins' OSMC 2022 talk on the redesign can be found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikMp5M3kt3k).
