SNClient+ is a (drop-in for most use cases) replacement for the well-known
NSClient++, which seems to be no longer maintained and has some security
issues. SNClient+ was written from scratch using todays state-of-the-art
technologies. The programming language used is Golang and all the test and
build procedures are located at github.com.

Have a look at the [installation howto](install) page for first steps.
