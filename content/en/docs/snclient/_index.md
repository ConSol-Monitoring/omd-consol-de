The Snclient is a (drop-in for most use cases) replacement for the well-known NSClient++, which seems to be no longer maintained and has some security issues.
Snclient was written from scratch using today's state-of-the-art technologies. The programming language used is Golang and all the test and build procedures are located at github.com.


Have a look at the [installation howto](install) page for first steps.
