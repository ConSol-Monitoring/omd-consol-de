**SNClient** is an open-source (drop-in for most use cases) general purpose monitoring agent as replacement for the well-known NSClient++.

It was written from scratch in [Golang](https://go.dev/) using todays state-of-the-art technologies. All the test and build procedures are located on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConSol-Monitoring/snclient).

It's available for Linux, Windows and MacOS for i386, x86_64 and arm64 ([detailed list of supported operating systems](https://omd.consol.de/docs/snclient/install/supported/)).

Have a look at the [installation](install) page for first steps.
