We are trying to build the SNClient+ to be as compatible as possible. Due to
limited hardware, we are not able to test the agent on all operating systems.

If you are using SNClient+ anywhere not listed here, feel free to open an issue
on github to update this page.

If there are no installer package for your system available for download, you might still succeed
by [building snclient from source](build).

### Windows

Successfully tested on:

- Windows 8
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows ARM 11 Preview (using the x86 pkg)

Others will quite likely work as well, but haven't been tested yet.

### Linux

Debian:

- Debian >= 8
- Ubuntu >= 16.04

RedHat:

- RHEL >= 7

## Mac OSX / Darwin

- OSX >= 13

## FreeBSD

Not yet tested.

## Other

Feel free to open an issue on github if you are running the agent somewhere not
listed here.
