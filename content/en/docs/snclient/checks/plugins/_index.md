This is the list of built-in check plugins. They work like the official [monitoring-plugins](https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/).

Each plugin usually has a help page which can be accessed by the `-h` or `--help` argument.

For example:

    ./snclient run check_nsc_web --help

The list of built-in checks can be found [here](../commands/).
