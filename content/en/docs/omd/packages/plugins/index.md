The Monitoring Plugins Development Team maintain a bundle of more than fifty standard plugins for Icinga, Naemon, Nagios, Shinken, Sensu, and other monitoring applications. Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type of check. Typically, your monitoring software runs these plugins to determine the current status of hosts and services on your network.
