**[Mod_Gearman](https://mod-gearman.org/)** is an easy way of distributing active Naemon checks across your network and increasing Naemon scalability.

It can even help to reduce the load on a single Naemon host, because its much smaller and more efficient in executing checks.

- Mod-Gearman 5.x works with [Naemon Core](https://www.naemon.io)

It consists of three parts:

- There is a NEB module which resides in the Naemon core and adds servicechecks, hostchecks and eventhandler to a Gearman queue.
- The counterpart is one or more worker clients executing the checks.
  The Worker can be configured to only run checks for specific host- or servicegroups.
  There is a (deprecated) worker included. The new worker can be found [here](https://github.com/ConSol-Monitoring/mod-gearman-worker-go).
- And you need at least one [Gearman Job Server](https://gearman.org) running.

## Features

- Reduce load of your central Naemon machine
- Make Naemon scalable up to thousands of checks per second
- Easy distributed setups without configuration overhead
- Real loadbalancing across all workers
- Real failover for redundant workers
- Embedded Perl support for very fast execution of perl scripts
- Fast transport of passive check results with included tools like send_gearman and send_multi
