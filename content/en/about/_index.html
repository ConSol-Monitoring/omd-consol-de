We are a team of monitoring consultants which exists since nearly 20 years. Our preferred tools are Naemon and Prometheus, both bundled along with other popular tools in the Open Monitoring Distribution OMD. Some of the worlds biggest monitoring environments were designed and implemented by us, all based on OMD.

<h1 class="text-center">The Open Monitoring Distribution started in 2010 as a collaboration project with several companies involved. Later we created our own fork, called "OMD Labs Edition", which allowed us to add innovative features at a high pace. </h1>

<h1 class="text-center">OMD is the basket of the most useful and popular tools from the Naemon (Nagios) and Prometheus ecosystems. We bundle these tools into one installation package which we release on a nightly basis. About twice a year there is also a stable version. (The nightly version can also be considered stable, as the build process ends with quite a lot of tests. The difference is mostly the format of the version number)
