The Citrus project sources are now available on GitHub for public checkout. You can clone/fork the Citrus project via Git and build your own version on your local machine. Visit the <a href="http://github.com/christophd/citrus">Citrus project site on GitHub</a> for more details.

I also added a <a href="http://www.citrusframework.org/quickstart.html">developer quickstart</a> that guides you through the steps in building Citrus with Maven. We hope that you can enjoy Citrus also on the development side and look forward to receive a lot of interesting ideas and suggestions for the project.
