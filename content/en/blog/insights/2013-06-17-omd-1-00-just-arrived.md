<p><a href="/assets/2012-04-04-omd-0-54-is-available/OMDLOGO_FINAL2.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="OMD-LOGO_FINAL2" border="0" alt="OMD-LOGO_FINAL2" src="/assets/2013-06-17-omd-1-00-just-arrived/OMDLOGO_FINAL2_thumb.jpg" width="107" height="107" /></a> The developer team of <a href="http://omdistro.org">OMD</a> (Open Monitoring Distribution) released the version 1.00 today. Three years after the project started we decided it was time to show that OMD is no longer under development but is a mature, proven product.</p>  <p>This version contains lots of updated packages including Nagios 3.5.0, Shinken 1.4, Multisite 1.2.2p2, Thruk 1.72, PNP4Nagios 0.6.21, NagVis 1.7.1, check_mk 1.2.2p2 and many more. </p>  <p>Using the <a href="/repo/">OMD Repository</a> installation is as simple as a <b>apt-get install omd</b>. If you have an rpm-based system, it's as simple as <b>yum install omd</b> or <b>zypper install omd</b>. </p>  <p>For those who weren't using OMD yet, now there is no more reason to hesitate. </p>
