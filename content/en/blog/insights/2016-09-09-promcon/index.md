[PromCon 2016] was the first conference around the [Prometheus] monitoring system. It took place from August 25 - 26 2016 at Google Berlin as a single-track event with space for 80 attendants.

We took the opportunity and did a lightning talk introducing [grok_exporter], which is a tool for extracting Prometheus metrics from application logs.
