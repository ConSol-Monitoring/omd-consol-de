As 2011 is now nearly history, it's time for a short look behind what happened to [labs.consol.de](/) and its projects this year.

* Our [support forum](/forum/) has been started. It is in quite good use as it seems.
* [mod_gearman](http://www.mod-gearman.org/) started its life on the [Nagios Workshop](http://www.nagios-wiki.de/workshop/2011/start) in Hannover and continously rocks the Nagios world since then.
* [Thruk](/nagios/thruk/) and [Jolokia](/jolokia/) reached their 1.0 releases,respectively (and independently ;-).
* All Nagios plugins got a major boost, with the rock-stars [check_logfiles](/nagios/check_logfiles/) and [check_oracle_health](/nagios/check_oracle_health/), which you probably can find on any larger Nagios installation nowadays.
* [Citrus](/citrus-framework/), **the** SOA testing framework, released version 1.1.
* Roland talked about Jolokia at the [Nagios Workshop](http://www.nagios-wiki.de/workshop/2011/themen#jmx), [Devoxx](http://www.parleys.com/d/2864) and [OSMC 2011](http://www.netways.de/index.php?id=3031&L=1), Gerhard about Shinken on the [Nagios Workshop](http://www.nagios-wiki.de/workshop/2011/themen#shinken) and also on [OSMC 2011](http://www.netways.de/index.php?id=2990&L=1) as suprise guest. Sven introduced mod_gearman at the [Nagios Workshop](http://www.nagios-wiki.de/workshop/2011/themen#gearman) and was the hidden star on OSMC 2011 ;-)

But what's up in the pipeline for 2012 ? Well, quite some stuff (like organizing a Nagios workshop), but let us surprise you ;-) ....

We wish you all out there a happy new year 2012 and exciting times in the Nagios and other worlds !
