Citrus is now also available as snapshot release in version 1.1. We already have incorporated some really great new features and fixed some issues. See below a list of new features for 1.1-SNAPSHOT.

New features in first 1.1-SNAPSHOT release:

<ul>
	<li>Sending SOAP attachments as a client</li>

	<li>SOAP Fault validation (validate SOAP faults with SOAP fault code and fault string)</li>

	<li>Extended exception validation (error message validation)</li>

	<li>Generate test documentation in Excel</li>

	<li>Extend test case meta-info with custom elements</li>

	<li>Write custom actions and extend test case with custom actions</li>
</ul>

Testing the latest snapshot version including feedback is now very important for us. Therefore we hope you can switch to the latest snapshot versions. There are still more features to come in version 1.1 so stay tuned.
