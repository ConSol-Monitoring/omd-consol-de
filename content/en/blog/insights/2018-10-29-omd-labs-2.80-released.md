## Whats new

### Updates
All components have been updated to their latest stable releases including

 - [__Thruk__](http://thruk.org/) 2.24
 - [__Naemon__](http://naemon.org/) 1.0.8
 - [__Icinga 2__](http://icinga.org/) 2.9.2
 - [__Grafana__](http://grafana.org/) 5.3.2
 - [__Prometheus__](http://prometheus.io/) 2.4.3

### New platforms supported
This OMD release comes with new prebuild packages for Fedora 28 and Ubuntu 18.04.

### SELinux Support
On Centos and redhat SELinux is now supported and you don't have to disable
SELinux anymore to run OMD.

### Improved OS Updates
Previous releases could not be uninstalled without removing all sites using
that version. This made it quite hard for OS updates, for example from Debian 8
to Debian 9. With the release 2.80 you can uninstall OMD but keep your sites.
Then upgrade your OS followed by reinstalling OMD and update your sites by
running `omd update` with the new version.

For example:

```
    #> apt-get dist-upgrade
    #> apt-get install omd
    #> su - site
    %> omd update
```

### OMD Cleanup
There is a new command `omd cleanup` which removes all omd versions which are
currently not used by any site. If no site exists on that machine, all omd
versions will be removed.

```
    #> omd cleanup
```

### New OMD Config Options
There are two new omd config options related to the apache webserver. You can
set an alias, which will be used as an alternative url prefix instead of the
usual sitename. This is useful if you have to use technical user and sitenames
but still want a nice url.

The second option redirects / to your site. This is useful if your machines only
job is OMD and you simply want to append the sitename to the url `/`.

### New Grafana Datasource
Next to the major update from Grafana 4 to Grafana 5 we added a Thruk
datasource.  This datasource can be used to query Thruks API for hostnames,
servicenames or any other livestatus data. This is useful to fill variables
used in dashboards or to create table widgets which textual data.
