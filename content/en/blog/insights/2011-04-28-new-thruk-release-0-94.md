Straight on the road to the [Thruk 1.0](http://www.thruk.org/) this will probably the last feature release so far.
The main focus was on usability and accessibility. This version will also be in the next OMD release.

<!--more-->
A lot of things have been done:

## New Cool Theme
There is a new cool theme included dedicated to the people saying the classic gui is too ugly.
I hope this theme is better. It's set as default theme, but if you changed your theme, you will
have to switch the theme in your preferences.

## Inline Pnp4nagios Graphing
Inline pnp4nagios graphs when using a /pnp4nagios/ action_url.

## Config Tool
Config tool to change most of the thruk config on the fly plus the possibility
to change htpasswd based users and your cgi.cfg.

## Problems View
added a new problems view which combines your host and service problems in a single page.

## Small Fixes
And a lot of small annoying things have been fixed, some of them are:
  - added regular expression filter for host/servicegroups
  - page moving when using the cursor keys in the search drop down
  - direct feedback when rescheduling hosts/services
  - small design issues
