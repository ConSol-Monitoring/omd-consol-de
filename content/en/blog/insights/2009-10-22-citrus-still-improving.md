<p>
	We fixed some issues in our 1.1-SNAPSHOT version of Citrus and also improved some features. For a detailed change history follow our <a href="http://www.citrusframework.org/changes-report.html" target="_blank" title="changes-report">changes report</a>.</p>
<p>
	The latest version now supports multi-threaded performance tests. We recently tested a SOAP WebService regarding performance using Citrus. I will try to add a new post describing how to accomplish performance testing with Citrus as soon as possible.</p>
