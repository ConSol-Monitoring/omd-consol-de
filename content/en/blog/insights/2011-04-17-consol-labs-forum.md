labs.consol.de hat nun ein [Forum](/forum) für Fragen rund um labs.consol.de
und unsere Open Source Projekte.

<!--more-->

labs.consol.de now hosts a [forum](/forum) for discussions
related to our open source projects.

<!--more-->
Now that labs.consol.de is only for nearly two years, a look at the
statistics reveals that it has been well received as a special
purpose site:

* About 20 Open Source projects are hosted, written by ConSol
  employees (mostly in their spare time)
* Roundabout 600 visits per day on labs.consol.de
* 74 blog posts, 25 pages and 1417 comments

Thank you very much for the great interest !

But as always, there is room for improvements and especially the
number of comments makes them rather hard to deal with. 483 comments
on [check_logfiles][2] might be worth an entry in the Guiness Book of
records, but there are not really good to handle as WordPress
comments.

Our solution is a dedicated support forum, exclusively setup for
questions on our open source projects. It is not a replacement for
general community forums like the [Nagios Portal][1]. General
questions to Nagios should be put there.

Have fun -->

Some hints:

* For writing discussions HTML can be used as well as [Markdown][4].
* Code examples can be highlighted by using <code>&lt;pre
  lang="perl"&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;</code> for Perl code, other
  languages can be specified as well.
