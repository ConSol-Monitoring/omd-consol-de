The next Citrus milestone release for version 1.2 has landed. This version introduces new REST Http support on client and server side. In particular we are now able to handle the Http request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, ...) as well as Http response codes (e.g. 404 Not Found).

Citrus 1.2.M2 now works with Spring 3.0, Spring Integration 2.0 and Spring WS 2.0. In addition to that we have some bugfixes and improvements in this release. Check out the reference documentation for the complete changes list on <a href="http://www.citrusframework.org/reference/html/index.html#whatsnew">what's new</a>.
