There is a now an 'unofficial' OMD Repository <a href="/repo/">OMD Repository</a>.
This makes new installations and upgrading your OMD sites even more easier.
<!--more-->

We created a package repository for every Linux distribution supported  by OMD (omdistro.org). And there have been meta packages added for  Debian and Ubuntu. By installing 'omd-daily' or 'omd' you get automatically new versions as they were released. Of course, your sites do not get updated automatically. This still should be done manually.
