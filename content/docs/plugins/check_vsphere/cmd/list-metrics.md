## Description

This command just uses the [general options](../../general-options/). It connects to the
vCenter and fetches a list of
[PerfCounterInfos](https://dp-downloads.broadcom.com/api-content/apis/API_VWSA_001/8.0U3/html/ReferenceGuides/vim.PerformanceManager.html#field_detail)
and displays them to you, so you can make use of them with the
[perf](../perf/) command.
